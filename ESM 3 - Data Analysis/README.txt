Title
-----
IoT Encryption/Decryption Algorithm Performance Analysis and Ranking (Research Code)

Manuscript Context
------------------
This archive forms part of the Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM) accompanying the manuscript.  
It provides the post-simulation data analysis and algorithm scoring routines applied to the CSV results produced by the IoT crypto simulation framework.  
The analysis standardizes encryption/decryption performance metrics, applies multiple weighted scoring strategies, determines per-device “best algorithm” configurations, and exports both standardized and summarized results for further study.

Contents
--------
Code files
- Data_Analysis/Data_Analysis_Performance.ipynb  (main analysis notebook)  
  The primary interactive Jupyter notebook version used for the research analysis and figure generation.  
  Supports cell-by-cell execution, inline output display, and detailed exploration of each weighting strategy.  

- Data_Analysis/Data_Analysis_Performance.py  (batch analysis script)  
  A programmatic, non-interactive version of the same analysis logic.  
  Designed for automated or repeated runs across all data sizes and weighting strategies without user intervention.  

- Data_Analysis/generate_env_info_auto.py  
  Utility script to automatically scan the analysis environment, detect installed packages, and produce a concise environment report for reproducibility.

Input files (generated from the simulation phase)
- Data_Simulation/Simulation Results/IoT_Encryption_Decryption_Simulation_Results_{DATA_SIZE}.csv  
  These CSVs are produced by the encryption/decryption simulation runner and serve as the input dataset for this analysis.  

Note:  
The `Data_Simulation/Simulation Results/` folder **must contain the CSVs generated by**  
`Data_Generation_Final.py`. These CSVs are **not bundled** here due to size but can be **regenerated** by rerunning the simulation stage.

Output files (automatically generated by this script)
- Data_Analysis/Standardized/standardized_results_{DATA_SIZE}_{weight_strategy}.csv  
  Scaled and weighted data for each algorithm configuration and weighting strategy.  
- Data_Analysis/Summary/summary_best_config_{DATA_SIZE}_{weight_strategy}.csv  
  Ranked summary identifying the best-performing algorithm per IoT configuration.

Environment descriptors
- Data_Analysis/requirements.txt                 (Python package list used for analysis stage)  
- Data_Analysis/appendix_environment_concise.txt (auto-generated environment summary; see note below)

To regenerate the environment file:
  python Data_Analysis/generate_env_info_auto.py --source Data_Analysis --out Data_Analysis/appendix_environment_concise.txt

This command re-scans the local project environment and recreates the environment record for reproducibility documentation.

System Requirements
-------------------
Python version: 3.13.2  
Supported OS tested: Windows 11 (AMD64)  
Dependencies: pandas, scikit-learn (for MinMaxScaler), re (standard library), IPython.display (for notebook output rendering)

Python Packages (pinning in requirements.txt)

# Data analysis dependencies used by this script  
pandas==2.3.0  
scikit-learn==1.7.1  
IPython==9.4.0  
jupyterlab==4.2.5  

# Supporting packages from simulation environment (if used together)

ascon==0.0.9  
xtwine==1.0.2  

Built-in / standard-library modules used
----------------------------------------
re, os (indirectly through file paths)

Installation
------------
Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

  python -m venv .venv
  .venv\Scripts\activate   (Windows)
  # source .venv/bin/activate   (Linux/macOS)

Install packages:

  pip install -r Data_Analysis/requirements.txt

Ensure that the simulation-generated CSVs exist in the following directory:

  C:/Users/willi/ML-Based IoT Device Encryption Algorithm Selection System/
    Data_Simulation/Simulation Results/

Project Layout (required directories)
-------------------------------------
project_root/
  Data_Simulation/
    Simulation Results/
      IoT_Encryption_Decryption_Simulation_Results_{DATA_SIZE}.csv
  Data_Analysis/
    Data_Analysis_Performance.ipynb          # <- main Jupyter analysis notebook
    Data_Analysis_Performance.py             # <- batch automation script
    generate_env_info_auto.py                # <- creates environment report
    appendix_environment_concise.txt         # <- generated environment details
    Standardized/                            # auto-created output folder
    Summary/                                 # auto-created summary folder

If paths differ, update the CSV read/write paths at the top of the script or in the notebook cells.

File Path Configuration
-----------------------
The analysis currently uses hardcoded absolute file paths referencing the original Windows development directory:

  C:/Users/willi/ML-Based IoT Device Encryption Algorithm Selection System/
    Data_Simulation/Simulation Results/

If you run this code on another system, you must update these path strings manually inside  
either the notebook (`Data_Analysis_Performance.ipynb`) or the batch script (`Data_Analysis_Performance.py`).

Example adjustment:

If your project is stored under:
  D:/Research/IoT_Encryption_Project/
    Data_Simulation/Simulation Results/

then modify the path variable in the code to:

  input_path = "D:/Research/IoT_Encryption_Project/Data_Simulation/Simulation Results/"

and adjust any output folder paths similarly if required.

Important notes:
- Keep the same subfolder structure (Data_Simulation/, Data_Analysis/, etc.).  
- Only modify the root path portion to match your system.  
- Use either forward slashes (/) or double backslashes (\\) for Windows paths.  
- On Linux/macOS, replace drive letters (e.g., C:/) with your user path, for example:  
    /home/username/IoT_Encryption_Project/Data_Simulation/Simulation Results/

What the Analysis Does
----------------------
1. Loads simulation output CSVs for all predefined data sizes (e.g., 0.0078125 KB, 2 KB, 3 KB, 900 KB, 1024 KB, 5120 KB).  
2. Filters records for specific threat and sensitivity levels (1, 1).  
3. Removes unused host-level metrics to focus on IoT-relevant features.  
4. Applies multiple weighted scoring strategies, including:  
   - Duration > RAM Usage > ROM Usage > Battery Usage  
   - RAM Usage > ROM Usage > Battery Usage > Duration  
   - ROM Usage > Battery Usage > Duration > RAM Usage  
   - Battery Usage > Duration > RAM Usage > ROM Usage  
5. Uses Min–Max scaling to normalize each parameter and compute inverted scores (lower = better).  
6. Calculates weighted sums for encryption and decryption separately, and aggregates total weighted scores.  
7. Evaluates feasibility flags (RAM, ROM, Battery, and combined performance).  
8. Determines the best-performing algorithm per IoT configuration based on the highest total weighted score.  
9. Exports both standardized datasets and summarized results to CSV for further analysis.

Key Parameters
--------------
- Input data sizes (KB): [0.0078125, 2, 3, 900, 1024, 5120]  
- Threat & Sensitivity levels used: 1 and 1  
- Weighting strategies: four predefined sets emphasizing different performance priorities  
- Scoring: Min–Max normalization with inverted weighting for lower-is-better metrics  
- Output paths: saved to /Data_Analysis/Standardized/ and /Data_Analysis/Summary/

Outputs
-------
- Console or notebook output: dataset summaries, scaling/feasibility reports, and algorithm rankings.  
- CSV files per data size and weighting strategy:
  C:/Users/willi/ML-Based IoT Device Encryption Algorithm Selection System/Data_Analysis/Standardized/
    standardized_results_{DATA_SIZE}{weight_strategy}.csv
  C:/Users/willi/ML-Based IoT Device Encryption Algorithm Selection System/Data_Analysis/Summary/
    summary_best_config{DATA_SIZE}_{weight_strategy}.csv

These contain normalized metrics, feasibility columns, and algorithm ranking results.

Quick Start
-----------
**Option 1: Interactive notebook execution (recommended for analysis and visualization)**  
From project_root:  
  jupyter notebook Data_Analysis/Data_Analysis_Performance.ipynb  
or open via JupyterLab and run all cells sequentially.

**Option 2: Batch command-line execution (for automated full analysis)**  
From project_root:  
  python Data_Analysis/Data_Analysis_Performance.py  

Both methods will automatically analyze all available simulation results and export standardized and summary CSVs for each weighting strategy.

Reproducibility Checklist
-------------------------
- Python 3.13.2 in a fresh virtual environment  
- Required packages installed via Data_Analysis/requirements.txt  
- Simulation results CSVs present in Data_Simulation/Simulation Results/  
- Folder structure preserved for Data_Analysis outputs  
- Data_Analysis/appendix_environment_concise.txt included for runtime provenance  
  (auto-generated by Data_Analysis/generate_env_info_auto.py)

Security and Scope
------------------
- This analysis performs data normalization and scoring only; it does not conduct encryption or use any cryptographic keys.  
- All operations are deterministic given identical input CSVs.  
- File paths are Windows-style by default; modify for cross-platform use if necessary.  
- The Jupyter notebook version allows intermediate result inspection and visualization.

Known Limitations
-----------------
- Path names are hardcoded; adjust manually for Linux/macOS environments.  
- Weighting strategies are fixed; to test additional sets, extend the weight_sets list in code.  
- Uses in-memory pandas operations; large CSVs may require additional RAM.  
- Notebook visualization output may vary slightly depending on the IPython/Jupyter version.
